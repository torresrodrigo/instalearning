# Self-Review Checklist - Senior Developer Perspective

Use this checklist before committing code. Think like a senior developer reviewing a junior's pull request.

## üîç Architecture & Design Review

### Separation of Concerns
- [ ] Is each class/struct responsible for one thing?
- [ ] Are business logic and UI concerns properly separated?
- [ ] Do dependencies flow in the correct direction (inward to domain)?
- [ ] Are there any inappropriate dependencies between layers?

### Testability Assessment
- [ ] Can this code be easily unit tested?
- [ ] Are dependencies injected rather than hardcoded?
- [ ] Are async operations properly structured for testing?
- [ ] Would a new team member know how to test this?

### Error Handling Strategy
- [ ] Are all error cases properly handled?
- [ ] Do error messages provide actionable information?
- [ ] Is there consistent error handling patterns across the codebase?
- [ ] Are network errors, parsing errors, and business logic errors distinguished?

## üé® SwiftUI & UI Review

### State Management
- [ ] Is state minimal and in the right place?
- [ ] Are @State, @StateObject, and @ObservedObject used correctly?
- [ ] Is there any unnecessary state that causes extra re-renders?
- [ ] Are bindings used appropriately?

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Are expensive operations moved off the main thread?
- [ ] Are images loaded and cached efficiently?
- [ ] Are large lists using LazyVStack/LazyHStack appropriately?
- [ ] Are there any retain cycles or memory leaks?

### Accessibility & Usability
- [ ] Are accessibility identifiers provided for testing?
- [ ] Is the interface navigable with VoiceOver?
- [ ] Does the UI work with different text sizes?
- [ ] Are loading and error states handled gracefully?

## üí° Code Quality & Maintainability

### Readability Assessment
- [ ] Would a new team member understand this code in 6 months?
- [ ] Are variable and function names self-documenting?
- [ ] Is the complexity appropriate for the problem being solved?
- [ ] Are comments explaining WHY, not WHAT?

### Future Maintenance
- [ ] How easy would it be to add a new similar feature?
- [ ] What would break if requirements change slightly?
- [ ] Are there hardcoded values that should be configurable?
- [ ] Is the code DRY but not over-abstracted?

### Team Scalability
- [ ] Can multiple developers work on this code simultaneously?
- [ ] Are merge conflicts likely with this structure?
- [ ] Is the code style consistent with the rest of the codebase?
- [ ] Are there clear extension points for new features?

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

### Architecture Smells
- [ ] Massive view controllers or view models
- [ ] UI code mixed with business logic
- [ ] Direct database/network calls from UI layer
- [ ] Global state or singletons used inappropriately

### SwiftUI Anti-Patterns
- [ ] Complex state management in views
- [ ] Force unwrapping without proper justification
- [ ] @StateObject used where @ObservedObject should be
- [ ] Expensive operations in view body

### General Code Smells
- [ ] Long parameter lists
- [ ] Nested if statements more than 3 levels deep
- [ ] Duplicated code across multiple files
- [ ] Comments that explain what instead of why

## üéì Senior Developer Questions

Ask yourself these questions:

### Technical Leadership
1. **Mentoring**: How would I explain this code to a junior developer?
2. **Code Review**: What would I comment on if reviewing this as a PR?
3. **Standards**: Does this code set a good example for the team?
4. **Documentation**: What context would help future maintainers?

### Strategic Thinking
1. **Scalability**: How does this handle 10x the current data/users?
2. **Evolution**: What happens when requirements change?
3. **Integration**: How does this fit with the rest of the system?
4. **Risk**: What could go wrong and how do we mitigate it?

### Business Impact
1. **User Experience**: Does this solve the user's problem effectively?
2. **Performance**: Will this maintain good app performance?
3. **Reliability**: Can users depend on this feature working?
4. **Maintainability**: What's the total cost of ownership?

## ‚úÖ Approval Criteria

Only commit when you can answer "yes" to these:

- [ ] I understand every line of code I'm committing
- [ ] I've considered the impact on other team members
- [ ] I've thought about future maintenance and evolution
- [ ] I would be comfortable explaining this code in a presentation
- [ ] This code makes the overall system better, not just solves the immediate problem

## üìö Continuous Learning Questions

After each self-review, reflect on:

1. What pattern or technique did I learn during this implementation?
2. What would I do differently if starting from scratch?
3. How has my approach changed since becoming more senior?
4. What advice would I give to my past self about this problem?

Remember: Senior developers don't just write code that works - they write code that enables the entire team to be successful.
