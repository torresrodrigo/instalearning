# Phase 1: Architecture Decisions & Rationale

## üèó MVP + Clean Architecture Implementation

### Decision: Three-Layer Architecture
**Context**: Need scalable architecture for learning app with future API integration
**Decision**: Implement Domain ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Presentation layers with dependency inversion
**Rationale**: 
- Testability: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- Scalability: Easy to swap implementations (mock ‚Üí API)
- Team Development: Clear boundaries for multiple developers
- Maintenance: Changes in one layer don't cascade to others

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- ‚úÖ Higher initial complexity for better long-term maintainability
- ‚úÖ More boilerplate but clearer separation of concerns
- ‚ùå Potential over-engineering for small features
- ‚ùå Steeper learning curve for junior developers

### Decision: Dependency Injection Container
**Context**: Need to manage dependencies across layers
**Decision**: Custom DIContainer with protocol-based registration
**Rationale**:
- Testing: Easy to inject mocks and test doubles
- Flexibility: Swap implementations at runtime (mock/production)
- Single Responsibility: Each class depends only on what it needs

**Alternative Considered**: Static dependencies
- Rejected because it makes testing difficult and creates tight coupling

### Decision: Result Type for Error Handling
**Context**: Need consistent error handling across async operations
**Decision**: Use Swift's Result<Success, Failure> for all repository methods
**Rationale**:
- Explicit: Forces error handling at call sites
- Type Safety: Compiler ensures all error cases are handled
- Composability: Easy to chain and transform operations

### Decision: @Observable vs ObservableObject
**Context**: Swift 6 introduces new observation system
**Decision**: Start with @Observable for new ViewModels
**Rationale**:
- Performance: More efficient observation with fewer false updates
- Simplicity: Cleaner syntax and less boilerplate
- Future-Proof: Apple's recommended approach going forward

## üìù Senior Developer Insights

### Why This Architecture Matters at Scale
1. **Team Growth**: New developers can work on single layers without understanding the entire system
2. **Feature Development**: Features can be developed and tested independently
3. **Code Reviews**: Smaller, focused changes are easier to review
4. **Maintenance**: Business logic changes don't affect UI code and vice versa

### What I Would Tell a Junior Developer
"Don't build this architecture for a toy project. But for anything that will grow beyond you as a single developer, this investment in structure pays dividends. The key is understanding that we're not just solving today's problem - we're making tomorrow's problems easier to solve."

### Questions for Future Consideration
1. How will this architecture handle offline-first requirements?
2. What happens when we need real-time data updates?
3. How do we manage feature flags across these layers?
4. What's our strategy for data migration and versioning?

## üéØ Next Phase Preparation
- Document navigation architecture decisions
- Consider how deep linking will work with this structure
- Plan for state persistence across app lifecycle
- Think about analytics and crash reporting integration points
